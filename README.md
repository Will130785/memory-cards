And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.
Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

./configure
make
make install

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets executed.
Deploying / Publishing

give instructions on how to build and release a new version In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, this is the right time to state it.

packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.
Versioning

We can maybe use SemVer for versioning. For the versions available, see the link to tags on this repository.
Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.
